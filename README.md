# TryHackMe-Writeups

## About Me

As a lifelong learner I'm interested in uncovering the unexplained and deep diving into whatever sparks my interest. I began a Certificate 4 in Cyber Security roughly a yeah and a half ago and completed it. It taught me some fundamental concepts and introduced me to the TryHackMe platform which I absolutely love. While this is my thing right now, I'm sure it won't be too long until I find something new to deep dive into.&#x20;



## Why TryHackMe and Gitbook?

TryHackMe is a place I've learnt and grown as a cyber security geek and Gitbook works as a place to document that interest and show my thought process.&#x20;



## What tools I use?

* Kali Linux
* Visual Studio Code
* Metasploit
* VMWare Fusion
